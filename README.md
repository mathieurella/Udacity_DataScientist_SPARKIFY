# Udacity_DataScientist_SPARKIFY

## Project Motivation
"Sparkify" is a music streaming company, who gave us data log to predict churned user using machine learning model.

Sparkify offers digital music service through streaming, similar to Spotify and Deezer. Sparkify has two account options: Free and Premium. The free account has advertisements between songs, whereas the premium account has no advertisements, costing a monthly fee. Customers can upgrade, downgrade or cancel the service at any time. 

We will be working with a small dataset (128MB), containing information about customers and their activity in the platform.

The reason why we will be working with a small fraction of the data is because this model is still being tested. Therefore, using a small dataset is way of, not only avoiding spending too long training the model, but also having a sense of the chosen model's accuracy before applying it to production data.

This project is divided in 6 parts:

1 - Load and Clean Dataset
</br>
2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
</br>
3 - Feature Engineering
</br>
4 - Pre Modeling
</br>
5 - Modeling
</br>
6 - Conclusions


## Requirements
